# AutoCode
Some random program that allows you to create code (Like Scratch bassicly, but with no UI) and the code will be "written" in Python.

## How it Works
So bassicly, it will have a bunch of options and you will need to pick and choose. And as you choose code will be edited in a Python file with the project's name. 
All the projects you created is stored in the "projects" folder.

## Options Explained
Option | Explanation/Definition
--- | ---
[1] Text | Bassicly it lets the string in the value have an output.
[2] Variable | Storing data, like a number or words etc.
[3] Input | Ask a Specfic Question and store it in a Variable.

## Planned/To do
- [ ] Continue working on a Project 
- [ ] If/Else Statement (Using Variables)
- [ ] Shows Variables created/defined

And if I am fully done with this, I will create *(maby idk)* a UI for the program.
